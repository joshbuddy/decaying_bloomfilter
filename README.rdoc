= Time Decaying Bloom Filter

Much like a bloom-filter except keys inserted decay over-time. 

== Usage

The configuration is identical to http://github.com/igrigorik/bloomfilter except you have two extra options, time and count. The TTL of any given key is time * count.

== There is much more to say!

But this is version 0.0.1. I'll write more about it later. (And commit some tests and what not.)
